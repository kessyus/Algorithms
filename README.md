# Algorithms

## Algorithms training and Competitive Programming.

I used to spend my spare time doing some algorithm training on the well known platforms such as Hackerrank, Topcoder, Codeforces, Project Euler and Codechef.

Recently I decided to start commiting my code to this repo to help whoever is trying to do the same problems, comparisons, future references and of course for fun. ðŸ˜Š

PS: I suggest you try to answer those tests alone! The more 'mistakes' I make,
the more I learn... so should you!
